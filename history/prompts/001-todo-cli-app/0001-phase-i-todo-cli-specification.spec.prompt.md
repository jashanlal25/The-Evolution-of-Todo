## Prompt

/sp.specify Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App CLI

Target audience: Hackathon participants building the first phase of "The Evolution of Todo" project; AI-generated code users and reviewers

Focus: Build a command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory and implements all basic-level features using spec-driven development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus

Success criteria:
- Implements all 5 core features: Add Task, Delete Task, Update Task, View Task List, Mark Task as Complete/Incomplete
- Correctly maintains task data in memory (no persistence)
- Provides clear and user-friendly CLI output for all commands
- Follows clean code principles and proper Python project structure
- All generated code adheres strictly to Phase I Constitution

Constraints:
- Technology stack: Python 3.13+, UV, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus
- Data storage: strictly in-memory; no files, databases, or external storage
- CLI-only interface; no GUI or web interfaces
- Generated code must be deterministic and explicit
- All tasks must have unique identifiers, title, description, and completion status

Not building:
- Phase II+ features (web interface, database persistence, AI agents, cloud deployment)
- Recurring tasks, reminders, notifications, or advanced task analytics
- Any manual coding; all implementation must be generated by Claude Code
- Networking, API endpoints, or external integrations

Deliverables:
- Specification file stored in `/specs/phase-1/` folder
- GitHub repository with `/src` folder containing generated Python source code
- README.md with setup and CLI usage instructions
- CLAUDE.md with instructions for Claude Code generation

Timeline: Complete Phase I development and code generation within the hackathon schedule

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Phase I Todo CLI application with the following components:

**User Stories (Prioritized P1-P4)**:
1. Add and View Tasks (P1) - Core MVP functionality
2. Mark Tasks as Complete/Incomplete (P2) - Essential status tracking
3. Update Task Details (P3) - Task modification capability
4. Delete Tasks (P4) - Task removal functionality

Each user story includes rationale for priority, independent testability description, and detailed Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios.

**Functional Requirements**: 13 requirements (FR-001 to FR-013) covering:
- Command-line interface operations
- Task CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- In-memory storage using Python data structures
- Input validation and error handling
- User-friendly output formatting

**Key Entities**: Task entity with unique ID, title, description, and completion status

**Success Criteria**: 7 measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes (SC-001 to SC-007) including:
- Performance targets (5 seconds for operations, 5 minutes setup time)
- Usability metrics (100% error message coverage, 80-character terminal compatibility)
- Reliability guarantees (no data corruption during session)

**Edge Cases**: 6 scenarios covering empty inputs, length limits, invalid IDs, special characters, and update validation

**Validation**: Created quality checklist at specs/001-todo-cli-app/checklists/requirements.md - all items passed

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete, validated specification for Phase I Todo CLI app on branch 001-todo-cli-app
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality checklist passed all validation items (content quality, requirement completeness, feature readiness)
- 📁 Files: specs/001-todo-cli-app/spec.md, specs/001-todo-cli-app/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.clarify` (if edge case handling needs refinement) or `/sp.plan` (to create implementation architecture)
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification follows SDD principles strictly - no implementation details, technology-agnostic success criteria, independently testable user stories. Ready for planning phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification completed without clarifications needed
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification Quality Checklist - PASS (all items)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.plan to design Python architecture following constitution separation of concerns principle
