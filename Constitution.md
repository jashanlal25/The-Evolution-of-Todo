Phase I Constitution

Project: The Evolution of Todo
Phase: I — In-Memory Python Console Application
Authority: This Constitution is the highest-priority governing document for Phase I. All specifications and all Claude-generated code MUST comply with it.

1. Purpose & Scope

This Constitution governs Phase I only of The Evolution of Todo project.

The purpose of Phase I is to establish:

Correct Spec-Driven Development discipline

Clean, deterministic Python CLI architecture

A stable foundation for future evolutionary phases

Phase I explicitly excludes persistence, networking, UI frameworks, AI agents, databases, and cloud infrastructure.

2. Core Architectural Principles
2.1 Spec-Driven Authority

Specifications are the single source of truth

No behavior, structure, or feature may exist unless explicitly defined in a spec

Code generation MUST be driven exclusively by Claude Code using specs

2.2 No Manual Code

Human-written application code is strictly forbidden

Any correction, refactor, or enhancement MUST occur through spec refinement

Regeneration is mandatory after spec updates

2.3 Determinism Over Cleverness

The system MUST behave deterministically

No randomness, hidden state, or implicit behavior

Explicit is always preferred over implicit

3. Functional Boundaries
3.1 Allowed Features (Exhaustive)

Only the following features are permitted:

Add Task

Delete Task

Update Task

View Task List

Mark Task as Complete / Incomplete

Any feature not listed above is out of scope for Phase I.

3.2 Data Lifetime

All task data MUST exist only in memory

No file system writes

No databases

No state persistence across program runs

4. Domain Model Laws
4.1 Task Entity

Each task MUST have:

A unique identifier

A title

A description

A completion status

No additional fields are permitted in Phase I.

4.2 Identity Rules

Task IDs MUST be generated by the system

Users MUST NOT supply task IDs

IDs MUST be stable for the lifetime of the program

5. CLI Interaction Rules
5.1 Console-Only Interface

The application MUST run in a terminal

No GUI, web, or API interfaces are allowed

5.2 Explicit User Actions

Each user action MUST be intentional and explicit

No hidden commands

No implicit side effects

5.3 User Feedback

Every command MUST produce clear console output

Success and failure states MUST be distinguishable

Error messages MUST be human-readable

6. Code Structure Constraints
6.1 Separation of Concerns

The codebase MUST be structured into distinct responsibilities:

CLI interaction

Business logic

Data models

These responsibilities MUST NOT be mixed in the same module.

6.2 Readability First

Favor clarity over brevity

Avoid deep nesting

Avoid magic values

7. Technology Constraints
7.1 Mandatory Stack

Python 3.13 or higher

UV for environment and dependency management

Claude Code for implementation

Spec-Kit Plus for specifications

7.2 Forbidden Technologies

External databases

ORMs

Web frameworks

AI SDKs

Async or concurrency frameworks

8. Evolutionary Compatibility
8.1 Forward Compatibility

Code SHOULD be structured to allow future persistence and AI integration

Phase I MUST NOT pre-optimize for later phases

8.2 Phase Isolation

Phase I code MUST stand alone

No placeholders, stubs, or mocks for future phases

9. Documentation Laws
9.1 Specification History

Every spec iteration MUST be preserved in /specs

Specs MUST NOT be overwritten

9.2 Repository Clarity

README.md MUST describe how to run Phase I

CLAUDE.md MUST instruct Claude Code to obey this Constitution

10. Enforcement Clause

If a generated implementation violates any clause in this Constitution:

The implementation is invalid

The specification MUST be refined

Claude Code MUST regenerate the implementation

No exception is permitted.
